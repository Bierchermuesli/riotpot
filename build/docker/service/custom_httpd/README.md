# HTTPS Service Configuration

To set up an HTTPS service using a custom Apache HTTP Server Docker image, you'll need to generate an SSL certificate (`server.crt`) and a private key (`server.key`). These files are necessary for enabling HTTPS encryption and securely serving your website.

## Generating SSL Certificate and Private Key

Follow these steps to generate a self-signed SSL certificate and private key:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: You'll need access to a command-line interface to generate the SSL certificate and private key.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Navigate to the directory where you want to store the SSL certificate and key files. If you're using the same directory as your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, there's no need to change directories.

3. **Generate the Certificate and Key**: Use the OpenSSL command-line tool to generate the SSL certificate and private key.

   ```
   csharpCopy code
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365
   ```

   The above command generates a self-signed SSL certificate (`server.crt`) and a corresponding private key (`server.key`) with a validity of 365 days. It will prompt you to enter some details for the certificate (e.g., Country Name, State or Province Name, Common Name).

4. **Protect the Private Key**: The `server.key` file contains sensitive information. Make sure to protect it and keep it secure. Avoid sharing it publicly or committing it to version control systems.
